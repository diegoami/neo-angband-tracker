# Engine/C session plan

1. Read the current checkpoint and open issues here. Review official C and Neo
   engine boards/source and our linked proposals first. No issue closure by
   upstream title alone.
2. Review C leads posted directly to this tracker by the two Rust Borg
   peers, borg-rs and borg-reborn-rs. Follow docs/BORG-RS-INTAKE.md; deduplicate by source issue/anchor/CBUG ID. Do not
   routinely fetch/watch either Rust repository, bug file or issue feed. Preserve
   historical provenance and distinguish reported leads from verified C faults.
3. Choose the source tree before implementation. Neo tasks use pristine
   upstream/master from neostryder/neo-angband. C tasks use angband/master at
   the recorded C pin, via the same fork's native C worktree. Read that tree's
   bootstrap docs. c-borg-reference stays pinned; never replace it with Neo.
4. Implement one defect in an isolated branch from the correct upstream base,
   not our documentation-bearing master/workbench branch. Compare the branch
   diff before opening a proposal. Keep upstream legal/credit policy intact.
5. Neo validation: build references (pnpm build/typecheck), relevant unit tests
   and required repository CI. C validation: native C build/tests and the
   saved/synthetic scenario under ordinary rules, before/after plus controls.
   Record actual commands, pins and limitations; parser/unit evidence is not
   automatically a full-game consequence. Coordinate heavy gates by flock.
6. C proposals/patches stay here, labelled c-proposal/postponed when parked;
   no official C submissions. Neo engine offers go to the Neo engine repo
   after duplicate/provenance checks. Do not offer a C behavioral departure
   to the Neo Borg port as parity. Route port omissions to the mod fork.
7. Keep patch/index/watch receipts current. The Rust peers (borg-rs,
   borg-reborn-rs) independently adopt or translate the C correction in Rust and links its own consumer record. Do not
   mutate or deploy the running lab from this session.
8. Checkpoint at merge/stop. Keep proposals, source fixes and linked consumer adoption distinct. Gameplay features remain parked.

Source refresh before a task:

```sh
git fetch upstream master   # Neo engine source reference
git fetch angband master    # original C source reference
```

Use the appropriate remote reference as the isolated fix branch base.
Owned master/workbench documentation commits are not source proposal bases.
