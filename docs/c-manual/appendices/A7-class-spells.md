## Legend

- **Lvl**: character level needed to learn. **Mana**: SP cost. **Fail**: base failure rate before level and stat adjustments (see [Chapter 1](../01-core-mechanics.md) and the stat tables in [A8](A8-races-and-classes.md)). **Exp**: the first successful cast gives `Exp * Lvl` experience (`spell_cast()` in `src/player-spell.c`).
- **Effect** is generated from the `effect:` lines: `plev` = character level, dice as in the data (`$` variables substituted with their expressions); `+1 per N plev` = radius/length grows every N levels.
- **Source** of a book: *town* books are always stocked by the Bookseller (`always:` lines for every book type in `store.txt`); *dungeon* books are found at the listed depths (`book-properties:` `cost:commonness:min to max`).
