Each town store: owners and purse limits, stock slots and turnover, items always stocked, the list normal stock is drawn from (with base cost and effect), what the store buys; then the pricing and restocking rules from `src/store.c`. Shopping strategy: [Chapter 11](../11-town-and-shopping.md).

## Rules from the source

FACT, from `src/store.c` unless noted:

- **Buying from a store** (`price_item()`, store selling): price = the object's full value (`object_value_real()`), times the quantity; the **black market** doubles it and then applies an adjust factor of 150%, i.e. **3x value**.
- **Selling to a store** (store buying): price = min(real value, known value) `* 2 / 3`; the black market pays half of that and applies a 50% factor, i.e. **1/6 of value**. The result is capped at the owner's purse (`owner:` max cost) per item. With `birth_no_selling` stores pay 0 (gold drops in the dungeon are increased instead, see [Chapter 11](../11-town-and-shopping.md)).
- Stores refuse worthless items and anything not on their `buy:` list (`store_will_buy()`); the home accepts anything.
- **Normal stock** is generated at object level `rand_range(1, 5 + max(max_depth - 20, 0))` (capped at 70; `store:magic-level` = 5 in `constants.txt`) with `apply_magic()` but no artifacts; items with negative to-hit/to-dam/AC or curses are rejected (`store_create_random()`). Each pick is uniform over the `normal:` list (duplicates count twice).
- **Black market** stock is any object generated at level `max_depth + 5 .. max_depth + 20` (min capped at 55, max at 70); it only keeps egos, items with to-hit > 1, to-dam > 2 or AC bonus > 2, or items worth at least 10 gold that no other store stocks (`black_market_ok()`).
- **Always** items are kept at a full stack (`max-stack`, 40 by default) and buying them does not deplete the stock (`store_maint()`).
- **Turnover**: when the stores are updated, each store sells off 1dturnover items and then buys 1d turnover new ones, keeping the stock between `slots` min and max (+ always items) (`store_maint()`).
- **Restock timing**: while you are in the dungeon a day counter increases every `10 * store:turns` = 10000 game turns (`process_world()` in `src/game-world.c`); on return to town each store is maintained once per elapsed day (`store_update()`), and owners are replaced with chance 1 in `store:shuffle` (25) per update. Buying out a store's last item triggers 10 maintenance passes.
- **Pile sizes** of generated stock (`mass_produce()`): food, flasks, lights: +3d5-3 if value <= 5 and again if <= 20; potions/scrolls: +3d5-3 if <= 60, +1d5-1 if <= 240; books: +2d3-2 if <= 50, +1d3-1 if <= 500; non-ego armour/weapons: +3d5-3 if <= 10 and again if <= 100; ammo: 20-40 if value <= 5, 10-40 if <= 50, 5-20 if <= 500, else 1.
- Store inventory is capped at `store:inven-max` = 24 slots.
