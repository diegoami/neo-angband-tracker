# Direct Rust Borg report intake

borg-rs (https://github.com/diegoami/borg-rs) and borg-reborn-rs
(https://github.com/diegoami/borg-reborn-rs) are the two Rust Borg peers,
independent projects with no Neo Angband responsibility. Both post reports
directly to diegoami/neo-angband-tracker. Those posted
reports are this workspace's intake entry point; no Rust worker or Rust
adoption task is managed here.

## Posted-report triage

Read the report on this tracker and deduplicate against canonical source
issues, existing CBUG IDs and source URLs/anchors. Reuse/comment on the
canonical issue rather than creating another source defect. Include
the reporting project's label, source:borg-rs or source:borg-reborn-rs
(created on first use), plus upstream-c/finding and an appropriate evidence/candidate
label where applicable. Record supplied source repository/issue/commit,
C pin, repro, controls and existing CBUG ID where known; missing evidence
remains a limitation, not an invitation to restart external polling.

Classify C-versus-Rust-only behavior and check source/version/line evidence,
human consequence and reproduction controls. Rust-reported native tests
remain source-reported evidence until independently verified here; never
silently promote a candidate. Ordinary native C source inspection and
verification remain in scope. Rust-only findings do not authorize Rust work.
No automatic issue creation, closure, translation, fix application or official
C posting follows from a directly posted report.

## Provenance and monitor routing

Keep Rust provenance in **Source** or discovery fields, not a watched
**Threads** status reference. Routine Rust polling is prohibited even when
it would happen indirectly through another monitor. The inherited
upstream-watch.mjs follows every external Threads reference without a source
allowlist; selecting a tracker repository alone does not filter its external
references. Before running it, verify the selected trackers have no Rust
Threads references. If that cannot be established, use scoped manual Neo/C
status checks and report the monitor limitation instead of running a broad
audit. A future allowlist/code correction is a separately scoped change;
this documentation update does not change the watcher implementation.

## Retained historical/manual evidence

Do not proactively poll/fetch the borg-rs or borg-reborn-rs repository,
their docs (including borg-rs docs/c-bugs.md) or external issue boards.
Do not run tools/borg-rs-watch.mjs at startup/end or
after source changes as a standing routine. Its implementation, tests,
last-successful baseline, existing read-only reference and historical
snapshots remain preserved as legacy/manual evidence. They do not define
a second live queue or authorize another managed clone. A separately
owner-requested historical/manual investigation must have explicit scope;
this document does not authorize background monitoring or Rust adoption.

## Source and consumer boundaries

The canonical C source issue links proposals/native receipts. Independently
supplied external Rust receipts may be linked as evidence; this workspace
neither dispatches nor manages their work. Consumers do not duplicate source
state. Port-fidelity work remains
in neo-angband-borg-mod-tracker, not a C-correction translator. The standing
pause on angband/angband submissions and prohibition on Rust source changes
remain in force.
